This is the process I'm going through to learn about GITHUB!!
It is very exciting and fun, and doesn't make everything awful.
1. Create account
2. Create repository
3. Clone the repsitory to my Linux machine
4. Create this AWESOME file
5. Add the file, commit it, and push the commit to GitHub
6. Go to GitHub and edit the text file
7. Return to the Linux machine and issue the git pull command from within your repository directory. (See updated file)
8. Delete this text file. (Bye Bye)
9. Use git checkout to restore the deleted file. (Yayyyy!)
10. Do SSH thing. (Barf)
GREAT JOB JAKE! YOU DID AMAZING AND SHOULD BE PROUD!! :)
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT BUT YOU WORKED THROUGH IT! (This is step 6)
